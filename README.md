# Online Bookstore (SQL Project)

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a simple Online Bookstore database using SQL. It covers database creation, table design, data insertion, and a set of SQL queries for analysis and reporting.

The Online Bookstore database allows you to:

Store information about books, customers, and their orders.

Run queries to retrieve insights such as best-selling books, total revenue, and customer purchase patterns.

Practice writing SQL queries from basic to advanced.



## Features & Queries

The project includes several SQL queries such as:

Find the most expensive and lowest stock book

Calculate total revenue

Advanced analytics like:

This project is open-source and free to use for learning and educational purposes.

Would you like me to make it more visually appealing with emojis, tables, and badges (GitHub-style), so it looks more professional and attractive to recruiters?
